  title: What does the class offer?
  subtitle: |
    This hands-on course will walk students through all the stages of a classical penetration testing assessment. Through alternating attack and defense classes, students will learn to attack and also defend real systems. Online students will be able to try, test, and reproduce what is taught in class thanks to our free software cyber range.
    This one-semester (14-week) course is free, online, and open to anyone in the world. 

  items:
    - title: Intense & Hands-on
