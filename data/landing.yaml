  title: What does the class offer?
  subtitle: This is a very practical course to learn how to do basic pentesting and basic defenses of systems. It is a one-semester course, free, online, and open to anyone in the world, teaching how to perform attacks and defenses in computer systems. 


  items:
    - title: Intense & Hands-on
      icon: speed
      description: The course is fast-paced and very practical. Every topic shown in the course is practiced and done by you. Each concept we teach needs to be tried to be completely understood. Much better learning happens when you can do, by yourself, every part of the course. The course goes through an intense pace of topics, examples, exercises and challenges.
 

    - title: From Zero to Hero
      icon: trending_up
      description: The class is open to anyone with basic computer and command line knowledge. No prior security experience is needed. You will learn networking, security fundamentals, pentesting, and defensive strategies. In one semester, you will exploit vulnerabilities, attack web pages, and use machine learning for defense.

    - title: Certificate of Completion
      icon: workspace_premium
      description: If you successfully complete the course, the Stratosphere Laboratory will give you a certificate of completion. This is not an official Czech Technical University certificate (that is still under approval) but it will guarantee you successfully complete the course.

    - title: Red Teaming
      icon: destruction
      description: The course is designed to have one class about attacking and one class about defending. This gives you real-world experience on how attacks work, how to make them happen, and how hard and fun is to exploit a remote computer.

    - title: Blue Teaming
      icon: security
      description: "In the defensive classes, you will learn the most difficult job in security: how to defend. From hardening a server to network forensics until you deploy your own machine learning detection models."
 
    - title: International Team
      icon: translate
      description: The teachers of the course come from different countries and backgrounds, giving us a very diverse point of view and understanding. From Latin America to Europe, we cover several cultures and idiosyncrasies.
